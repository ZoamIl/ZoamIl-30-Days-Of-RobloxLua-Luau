--INTRODUCTION--
Printing in RobloxLua (Luau) is a common way for displaying information in the output console.

By using the print function, you can easily show messages, variable values, or other details. Let's explore how printing works and its uses.

The print function takes content as a parameter and displays it in the output console. It serves as a means of communication for developers. 

--LEARNING--
For example, to print the message "Hello, beginner!" in the output console, use this code:

print("Hello, beginner!") When you run your script or game, the output console will show the message. This method facilitates communication and collaboration.

Printing is valuable for debugging or understanding code behavior. You can print variable values or messages to trace issues or observe program flow, aiding in error identification and code verification.

The print function can also perform math calculations, like divison, subtraction, but for this tutorial we're using addition.

For instance, to add 5 and 5 and display the result, if we say:

print(5+5) or print(5 + 5)

Running the game will show "10" in the output console, representing the sum.

But if you want for some reason to make it actually say 5+5 instead of the answer, we should say:

print("5+5") 

Running the game will show "5+5" in the output console. 

To print multiple items on the same line, separate them with commas, or full stops, but do not separate them with spaces nor connect the quotation marks, because it'll just display a syntax error:

print("Hello", "hi") 

The output console will display "Hello hi" with a space between the words, same goes for:

print("Hello hi")

--CONCLUSION--
In conclusion, the print function in RobloxLua (Luau) is a powerful tool for displaying information. 

It enables effective communication and debugging in your projects, whether it's text, variable values, or math calculations.
