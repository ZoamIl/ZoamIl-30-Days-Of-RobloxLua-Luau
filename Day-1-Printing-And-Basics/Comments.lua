--INTRODUCTION--
Comments are an important part of programming because they give useful information about the code. 

They allow programmers to explain their code, highlight important details, and provide insights into how it works. 

By using comments, developers can easily understand and make changes to the code in the future.

--LEARNING--
To show how important comments are, let's look at this line of code: 

print("Hey") -- This line of code will display the word "Hey" when the game is played. 

In this example, the comment gives extra information about the code, explaining that running this line of code will show the word "Hey" on the screen during the game.

These comments not only help the original programmer understand the purpose of the code, but they also benefit other developers who might need to understand, use, or modify the code in the future.

-CONCLUSION--
In conclusion, comments are a simple but essential part of programming.

They provide valuable information about the code, making it easier to understand, modify, and work together on. 

By adding comments to your code, you improve its overall quality.
