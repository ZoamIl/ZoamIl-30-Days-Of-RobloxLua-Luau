--INTRODUCTION--
Variables serve a crucial role in Lua scripting as they allow developers to store and manipulate data. 

In this essay, we will see the concept of Variables and their significance in programming.

--LEARNING--
Variables are containers that hold values, such as numbers or text, which can be used and modified throughout a script. 

They act as placeholders that store information and enable the program to perform calculations, make decisions, and interact with different elements within a game or application.

To better understand Variables, let's consider an example of a Variable:

local myPart = game.Workspace.Part

In this script, "myPart" is a Variable that represents a specific part in the game's workspace. 

By assigning the value "game.Workspace.Part" to the Variable, we can refer to this part easily in our code.

Once a variable has been defined, we can utilize it to perform various operations. For instance, let's modify the properties of "myPart" in the example script:

myPart.Transparency = 0.5
myPart.Reflectance = 0.4

Together would be:

local mypart = game.Workspace.Part

mypart.Transparency = 0.5
mypart.Reflectance = 0.4

In the above lines of code, we are accessing the "Transparency" and "Reflectance" properties of "myPart" and setting their values to 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. 

This allows us to manipulate the appearance and behavior of the part within the game.

In conclusion, variables are essential components of Lua scripting. 

They provide a means of storing and manipulating data, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive experiences in games or applications. 

By understanding how to define and utilize variables, programmers can unlock the full potential of their scripts and enhance the overall user experience.

--COMMON MISTAKES--
Variables Should not start with any special characters such as / , + , - , % , @ except _.

You cannot start a Variable with a number.

Variables are case-sensitive when it comes to programming languages, so be careful while calling the Variables in the print statement, For example:

local My_Name = 3
print(my_Name) 

This will show as an error because "my_Name" hasn't been declared but "My_Name" is.

Another mistake is this script:

local My_Name = 4
local Favorite_DecimalPoint = 4.5
local Text = "Hello"
print(My_Name+Favorite_DecimalPoint.. Text)

This will print "8.5Hello" but if we want to make it print "8.5 Hello", we say:

local My_Name = 4
local Favorite_DecimalPoint = 4.5
local Text = "Hello"
print(My_Name+Favorite_DecimalPoint, Text)

This will print "8.5 Hello" but do not seperate them with spaces or one dot, because it will result in a syntax error.

Last thing, is if we want to add a Variable(in the print statement) but theres already sentences in it, we're gonna seperate it with commas:

local Sandwiches = 10
print("I have",Sandwiches,"Sandwiches")

it's not gonna print "I have Sandwiches Sandwiches" but it's gonna print "I have 10 Sandwiches"
